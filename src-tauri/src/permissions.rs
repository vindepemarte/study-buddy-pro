/*!
 * Permissions Module
 *
 * Exposes Tauri commands for querying and requesting macOS privacy permissions
 * required by Thuki (Accessibility and Screen Recording), plus the pure-logic
 * helper that decides whether the onboarding screen must be shown.
 *
 * Architecture: thin command wrappers (excluded from coverage) delegate to
 * small, testable functions. The only logic exercised at test-time is
 * `needs_onboarding`, which is a pure predicate with no OS side-effects.
