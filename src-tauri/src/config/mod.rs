//! Application configuration module.
//!
//! This module is the single source of truth for Study Buddy Pro's runtime configuration.
//! Every subsystem reads resolved values from a Tauri-managed `AppConfig`
//! state. Compiled defaults live in `defaults`; the on-disk file at
//! the app-specific OS config directory overlays
//! user customizations on top.
//!
//! ## Public surface
//!
//! - [`AppConfig`] - the typed configuration shape.
//! - [`load`] - Tauri-aware entry point called once during app setup.
//! - [`load_from_path`] - pure, test-friendly variant that takes a `Path`.
//! - [`atomic_write`] - safe write that never produces a torn file.
//! - [`ConfigError`] - error type returned by loader and writer.
//!
//! v1 is read-only: the `set_config` Tauri command and the `RwLock<AppConfig>`
//! wrapper arrive with the future settings-panel PR.
