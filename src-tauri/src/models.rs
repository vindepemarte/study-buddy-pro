/*!
 * Active-model state module.
 *
 * Single source of truth for the locally-selected Ollama model. The "active"
 * model is whichever slug the user last picked via the picker popup,
 * persisted across launches in `app_config` under [`ACTIVE_MODEL_KEY`] and
 * mirrored in [`ActiveModelState`] for fast reads from Tauri commands.
 *
 * The backend treats Ollama's `/api/tags` response as authoritative: a
 * persisted model is only honored if it still appears in the live installed
 * list. If not, we fall back to the first installed model. There is no
 * compiled fallback: when nothing is installed and nothing is persisted,
 * the active model is `None` and the user is prompted to pick one.
