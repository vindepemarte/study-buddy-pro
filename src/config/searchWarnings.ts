/**
 * User-facing copy and severity mapping for the agentic search pipeline's
 * warnings. Kept in a const map rather than inline so the wording can be
 * tuned without editing component code.
 *
 * Severity drives the warning icon's appearance:
 * - "warn"  -> amber triangle, the pipeline still produced an answer.
 * - "error" -> red circle, the pipeline failed or the answer is unreliable.
