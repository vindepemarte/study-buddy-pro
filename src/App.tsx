                    a conversation is loaded (isChatMode → true) the panel unmounts
                    instantly - no exit animation runs alongside ConversationView
                    mounting. Without this, AnimatePresence would hold the panel in
                    the DOM during its exit while ConversationView is also present,
                    causing two rapid ResizeObserver → setSize() calls (jitter).
                    AnimatePresence is still used for the manual toggle (isHistoryOpen)
                    so the drawer height-animates smoothly open and closed. */}

                  viewport top-left (0,0) regardless of the transformed chat
                  ancestors. That is exactly where the native 48px window
                  snaps on collapse, so the icon and the window frame coincide
                  by construction and the icon can never be clipped/vanish.

                  Opacity/scale are driven by CSS (see `.thuki-mascot*` in
                  App.css), NOT Framer Motion. This is load-bearing: the panel
                  is a nonactivating NSPanel, and when it is not the key window
                  WKWebView throttles requestAnimationFrame. A Framer rAF tween
                  would then never repaint the mascot off its initial opacity:0
                  and the icon would vanish (it did, after ~7-8 rapid toggles).
                  A CSS-declared end-state is painted by the compositor
                  regardless of the rAF clock, so the settled icon is always
                  visible. Phase → class: `collapsing` blooms in, `minimized`
