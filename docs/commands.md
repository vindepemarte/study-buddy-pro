# Commands

Commands are written as whole-word `/` triggers anywhere in your message. Press `/` to open the command suggestion menu, then Tab to complete or Enter to select.

Commands can be combined when their behavior allows it. For example, `/screen /think` captures the screen and enables extended reasoning, while `/think /tldr` summarizes with thinking enabled.

Commands that operate on text follow a consistent input priority:

1. **Highlighted text + no typed text:** highlighted text is the input
2. **No highlighted text + typed text after command:** typed text is the input
3. **Both present:** highlighted text is the primary input; typed text is appended as an additional instruction

This means you can highlight text anywhere on screen, summon Thuki with double-tap Control, type a command, and hit Enter without retyping the selected content.

## /search

Runs agentic web search and answers from live sources with citations.

**Usage:** `/search <question>`

**Examples:**
- `/search who owns Figma now?`: searches live sources for a current answer
- `/search latest React 19 release notes`: retrieves recent release information from the web

**Behavior:** Routes the message through Thuki's local search pipeline instead of plain chat. Answers are grounded in retrieved web sources and typically include inline citations plus a Sources footer.

**Limit:** Requires the search sandbox to be running. Use it for current, changing, or cutoff-sensitive information.

## /screen

Captures your screen and attaches it as context for the current message.

**Usage:** `/screen [optional message]`

**Examples:**
- `/screen`: sends a screenshot with no additional message
- `/screen what is this error?`: attaches a screenshot and asks a question about it

**Behavior:** The screenshot is taken when you submit the message. Thuki's own window is excluded from the capture, and the image appears in your message bubble like a pasted screenshot.

**Composable:** `/screen` can combine with `/think` and utility commands. For example, `/screen /rewrite` captures the screen and rewrites whatever text the model can see.

**Limit:** One `/screen` capture per message. You may also attach up to 3 images manually for a total of 4 images per message.

**Permission:** Requires Screen Recording permission. If denied, Thuki cannot capture the screen until access is granted in System Settings.

## /think

Enables extended reasoning before the model responds.

**Usage:** `/think [optional message or highlighted text]`

**Examples:**
- `/think` with highlighted text: reasons through the selected content
- `/think what are the tradeoffs of a monorepo vs polyrepo?`: asks a question with deep reasoning enabled

**Behavior:** A collapsible Thinking block appears above the response showing the model's reasoning chain. The final answer appears below it as normal.

**Composable:** `/think` works with `/screen` and all utility commands. For example, `/think /tldr` summarizes with extended reasoning enabled.

---

## /translate

Translates text to another language.

**Usage:** `/translate [language] [text] or /translate with highlighted text`

**Examples:**
- `/translate` with highlighted text: auto-detects the source language and translates it
- `/translate ja` with highlighted text: translates highlighted text to Japanese
- `/translate Spanish meeting notes here`: translates typed text to Spanish

**Behavior:** Outputs only the translation with no commentary or explanation.

**Language format:** The target language can be a full name (`French`), ISO code (`fr`, `fra`), or common shorthand.

**Default behavior:** If no language is specified, non-English input translates to English and English input translates to Vietnamese.

---

## /rewrite

Rewrites text to read more naturally and clearly.

**Usage:** `/rewrite [text] or /rewrite with highlighted text`

**Examples:**
- `/rewrite` with highlighted text: rewrites the selected text
- `/rewrite so basically what happened was i was trying to fix the bug`: rewrites typed text for clarity

**Behavior:** Preserves the original meaning while improving flow and readability. Outputs only the rewritten text.

---

## /tldr

Summarizes text into 1-3 short, direct sentences.

**Usage:** `/tldr [text] or /tldr with highlighted text`

**Examples:**
- `/tldr` with highlighted text: summarizes the selected content
- `/tldr [paste a long article]`: summarizes typed or pasted text

**Behavior:** Captures the core message, key decision, or critical takeaway. Skips background detail and qualifications.

---

## /refine

Fixes grammar, spelling, and punctuation while preserving your voice.

**Usage:** `/refine [text] or /refine with highlighted text`

**Examples:**
- `/refine` with highlighted text: corrects the selected text
- `/refine hey just wanted to follow up on the thing we discussed`: cleans up typed text

**Behavior:** Corrects errors and smooths rough phrasing without restructuring or adding new ideas. Your original tone and meaning stay intact.

## /bullets

Extracts key points from text as a markdown bullet list.

**Usage:** `/bullets [text] or /bullets with highlighted text`

**Examples:**
- `/bullets` with highlighted text: extracts key points from the selection
- `/bullets [paste meeting notes]`: extracts key points from typed or pasted content

**Behavior:** Each point is a concise, self-contained statement. Ordered by importance or logical sequence. Filler and repetition are removed. Output uses `- ` prefixed markdown bullets.

---

## /explain

Explains any concept, term, or code snippet in plain language, always with a concrete example.

**Usage:** `/explain [text] or /explain with highlighted text`

**Examples:**
- `/explain` with highlighted code: explains what the code does and why
- `/explain what is a closure?`: explains the concept with a concrete example
- `/explain JWT`: breaks down the term with a real-world analogy and example

**Behavior:** Outputs a brief explanation followed by at least one concrete example. Assumes no background knowledge. Skips jargon or defines it when unavoidable. No intro or sign-off.

---

## /todos

Summarizes what a piece of text is about, then extracts every task, action item, and commitment as a markdown checkbox list.

**Usage:** `/todos [text] or /todos with highlighted text`

**Examples:**

- `/todos [paste a conversation or notes]`: processes typed or pasted content
