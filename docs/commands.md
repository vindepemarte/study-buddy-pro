# Commands

Repository: [study-buddy-pro](https://github.com/vindepemarte/study-buddy-pro)

Commands are written as whole-word `/` triggers anywhere in your message. Press `/` to open the command suggestion menu, then Tab to complete or Enter to select.

Commands can be combined when their behavior allows it. For example, `/screen /think` captures the screen and enables extended reasoning, while `/think /tldr` summarizes with thinking enabled.

Commands that operate on text follow a consistent input priority:

1. **Highlighted text + no typed text:** highlighted text is the input
2. **No highlighted text + typed text after command:** typed text is the input
3. **Both present:** highlighted text is the primary input; typed text is appended as an additional instruction

This means you can highlight text anywhere on screen, summon Study Buddy Pro with double-tap Control on macOS or Ctrl+Space on Windows, type a command, and hit Enter without retyping the selected content.

## Image input on text-only models

`/extract`, `/tldr`, `/translate`, `/rewrite`, `/refine`, `/bullets`, `/todos`, and `/explain` read attached images through local OCR: macOS Vision on macOS, `gemma4:e2b` through Ollama on Windows beta. See [OCR-supported commands](./ocr-commands.md) for the full list and details.

## /search

Runs agentic web search and answers from live sources with citations.

**Usage:** `/search <question>`

**Examples:**
- `/search who owns Figma now?`: searches live sources for a current answer
- `/search latest React 19 release notes`: retrieves recent release information from the web

**Behavior:** Routes the message through Study Buddy Pro's local search pipeline instead of plain chat. Answers are grounded in retrieved web sources and typically include inline citations plus a Sources footer.

**Limit:** Requires the search sandbox to be running. See [agentic-search.md#setup](agentic-search.md#setup) for setup steps. Use it for current, changing, or cutoff-sensitive information.

## /extract

Extracts all visible text from screenshots or attached images using the platform local OCR path.

**Usage:** `/extract [optional message]`

**Examples:**
- `/extract` with an attached image: extracts all text from the image
- `/screen /extract`: captures the screen and extracts all visible text

**Behavior:** Text is extracted locally and returned verbatim in a code block. macOS uses Vision OCR; Windows beta uses the local `gemma4:e2b` Ollama vision model. No prose or explanation is added. When multiple images are provided, each result is separated by a horizontal rule. Returns "[No text detected]" when no readable text is found.

**Composable:** `/extract` can combine with `/screen` to capture then extract in one step.

**Permission:** Uses the same `/screen` capture requirements when combined with it. macOS requires Screen Recording permission; Windows does not.

---

## /remember

Saves readable text from an attached image or `/screen` capture into the active Study Pack.

**Usage:** `/remember [optional note]`

**Examples:**
- `/screen /remember priority signs`: captures the screen and saves it under the active pack
- `/remember chapter 4` with an attached image: OCRs the image and saves it as context

**Behavior:** Runs local OCR, optionally adds MLX Vision structured page notes on Apple Silicon, copies available image files into app data, stores the extracted text as structured Study Pack context, and indexes it for later questions and answer checks. It does not call the chat model.

**Composable:** `/remember` can combine with `/screen` or multiple attached screenshots. The active Study Pack is required.

**Permission:** Uses the same `/screen` capture requirements when combined with it. macOS requires Screen Recording permission; Windows does not.

---

## /check

Checks a quiz answer or question using retrieved context from the active Study Pack.

**Usage:** `/check <question or answer> or /screen /check <question>`

**Examples:**
- `/check is B correct here?` asks using the active Study Pack
- `/screen /check did I choose the right answer?`: OCRs the visible quiz and compares it with saved context

**Behavior:** Retrieves relevant indexed chunks from the active Study Pack, optionally OCRs the current screenshot, and asks the model to correct the student step by step with source IDs. If the saved context is insufficient, it should say what is missing rather than guess.

**Composable:** `/check` can combine with `/screen` and `/think`. The active Study Pack is required.

---

## /screen

Captures your screen and attaches it as context for the current message.

**Usage:** `/screen [optional message]`

**Examples:**
- `/screen`: sends a screenshot with no additional message
- `/screen what is this error?`: attaches a screenshot and asks a question about it

**Behavior:** The screenshot is taken when you submit the message. Study Buddy Pro's own window is excluded from the capture, and the image appears in your message bubble like a pasted screenshot.

**Composable:** `/screen` can combine with `/think` and utility commands. For example, `/screen /rewrite` captures the screen and rewrites whatever text the model can see.

**Limit:** One `/screen` capture per message. You may also attach up to 3 images manually for a total of 4 images per message.

**Permission:** macOS requires Screen Recording permission. Windows beta captures through the local desktop APIs without a Screen Recording permission prompt.

---

## /think

Enables extended reasoning before the model responds.

**Usage:** `/think [optional message or highlighted text]`

**Examples:**
- `/think` with highlighted text: reasons through the selected content
- `/think what are the tradeoffs of a monorepo vs polyrepo?`: asks a question with deep reasoning enabled

**Behavior:** A collapsible Thinking block appears above the response showing the model's reasoning chain. The final answer appears below it as normal.

**Composable:** `/think` works with `/screen` and all utility commands. For example, `/think /tldr` summarizes with extended reasoning enabled.

---

## /study

Starts a step-by-step tutoring session from typed text, highlighted text, or OCR context.

**Usage:** `/study [material or question]`

**Examples:**
- `/study I cannot understand photosynthesis`: starts a guided explanation with checks
- `/screen /study`: captures the screen and studies what is visible

**Behavior:** Explains one small concept, asks a check question, adapts from the answer, and tracks learning locally.

**Composable:** `/study` works with `/screen` and attached images through local OCR.

---

## /quiz

Creates a short adaptive quiz from the current material.

**Usage:** `/quiz [topic or material]`

**Examples:**
- `/quiz fractions`: asks one question at a time
- `/screen /quiz`: quizzes from the visible page or exercise

**Behavior:** Asks one question, waits for the student response, then grades and explains the mistake or next step.

**Composable:** `/quiz` works with `/screen` and attached images through local OCR.

---

## /vocab

Starts the vocabulary mastery loop for difficult words.

**Usage:** `/vocab [word or material]`

**Examples:**
- `/vocab photosynthesis`: teaches definitions through original sentences
- `/screen /vocab`: extracts difficult words from the visible material

**Behavior:** Teaches one definition at a time, asks for original sentences, requires 3-5 correct uses, then explains etymology.

**Composable:** `/vocab` works with `/screen` and attached images through local OCR.

---

## /translate

Translates text to another language.

**Usage:** `/translate [language] [text] or /translate with highlighted text`

**Examples:**
- `/translate` with highlighted text: auto-detects the source language and translates it
- `/translate ja` with highlighted text: translates highlighted text to Japanese
- `/translate Spanish meeting notes here`: translates typed text to Spanish

**Behavior:** Outputs only the translation with no commentary or explanation.

**Composable:** `/translate` works with attached images or `/screen`. Vision OCR extracts the text first; translation runs on the result. Omitting a target language defaults to Vietnamese.

**Language format:** The target language can be a full name (`French`), ISO code (`fr`, `fra`), or common shorthand.

**Default behavior:** If no language is specified, the text is translated to Vietnamese.

---

## /rewrite

Rewrites text to read more naturally and clearly.

**Composable:** `/rewrite` works with attached images or `/screen`. Vision OCR extracts the text first, then rewrites it.

---

## /tldr

Summarizes text into 1-3 short, direct sentences.

**Usage:** `/tldr [text] or /tldr with highlighted text`

**Examples:**
- `/tldr` with highlighted text: summarizes the selected content
- `/tldr [paste a long article]`: summarizes typed or pasted text
