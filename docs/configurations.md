# Configurations

Thuki reads its runtime configuration from a single TOML file located at:

```
~/Library/Application Support/com.quietnode.thuki/config.toml
```

The file is created automatically the first time the app launches. You can edit it with any text editor; changes take effect on the next launch. The in-app Settings panel (⌘,) writes to this same file, so editing by hand and clicking through the panel are interchangeable.

## First launch

You do not need to do anything. Thuki writes a default `config.toml` on first run with every field set to a sensible value.

If the directory cannot be written (disk full, permission denied, read-only filesystem), Thuki shows a native alert with the specific error and exits. This is a macOS-level setup problem; Thuki cannot repair it on your behalf.

## Editing

Open the file, change a value, save, relaunch Thuki.

```bash
# Opens the file in your default TextEdit-like editor
open ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.quietnode.thuki/config.toml
```

## Reading the reference tables

Every domain below is shown as a single table that lists **all** constants Thuki uses in that area: both the ones you can tune in `config.toml` and the ones baked in at compile time. The columns are:

- **Constant**: the TOML key (tunable) or Rust/TypeScript identifier (baked-in).
- **Default**: the value Thuki ships with.
- **Tunable?**: `Yes` if editable via `config.toml`, `No` if compiled in.
- **Why not tunable**: only filled for baked-in constants; explains why it is locked.
- **Bounds**: the allowed range for tunable numbers. Values outside this range are reset to the default and a warning is logged.
- **Description**: what the constant controls, in plain language. For tunable numbers, this also explains what raising or lowering the value actually does for you.

## Reference

### `[inference]`

Selects the normal chat provider and keeps the local Ollama knobs available. `provider = "openrouter"` sends chat, direct screenshot/image turns, embeddings, and future speech API work through OpenRouter. `provider = "ollama"` keeps normal chat local. In both modes, conversation history, Study Packs, OCR text, screenshots copied into app data, and embedding vectors remain in the local SQLite/app-data store.

For Ollama, the active model itself is **not** a TOML setting: Thuki discovers installed models live from Ollama's `/api/tags` endpoint, lets you pick one from the in-app model picker, and stores that selection in its local SQLite database (`app_config` table). Storing the active slug in TOML would duplicate ground truth from Ollama and break the moment you remove a model with `ollama rm`, so it lives next to the conversation history instead.

When no model is installed and no choice has been persisted, Thuki refuses to dispatch a chat request and surfaces a "Pick a model" prompt in the input area. Pull a model with `ollama pull <slug>` and select it from the picker chip in the top-right of the overlay.

| Constant     | Default                    | Tunable? | Why not tunable | Bounds        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :----------- | :------------------------- | :------- | :-------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider` | `"ollama"` | Yes | — | `"ollama"` or `"openrouter"` | Chooses the inference provider for normal chat. OpenRouter uses API calls and Settings-selected models. Ollama uses the local daemon and model picker. |
| `ollama_url` | `"http://127.0.0.1:11434"` | Yes      | —               | non-empty URL | The web address where Thuki finds your local Ollama server. The default works if you run Ollama on this machine with its standard port. Change this only if you moved Ollama to a different port or another machine. |
| `keep_warm_inactivity_minutes` | `0` | Yes | — | `-1` or `[0, 1440]` | Minutes of inactivity before Thuki tells Ollama to release the model from VRAM. `0` means do not manage: Ollama's own 5-minute default applies. `-1` means never release (stays until Ollama exits or you unload manually). Raise for longer sessions between uses; lower to reclaim VRAM sooner. |
| `num_ctx` | `16384` | Yes | — | `[2048, 1048576]` | Context window size in tokens sent to Ollama with every request. Warmup and chat share this value so Ollama reuses the same runner instance and its cached KV prefix for the system prompt: they must match or Ollama creates a second runner and the warmup saves nothing. Ollama silently clamps this to the model's physical maximum, so values above the model's capacity are accepted but have no extra effect. Raise to fit longer conversations without the model forgetting early messages: each doubling roughly doubles VRAM for the KV cache; lower to reclaim GPU memory at the cost of a shorter effective history. 16384 is the default because it comfortably holds the full system prompt (~4000 tokens) plus many turns while staying within 8 GB GPU budgets. See [Tuning the Context Window](./tuning-context-window.md) for a 5-minute benchmark recipe to find the right value for your hardware. |

If the active model has been removed from Ollama between launches, Thuki silently falls back to the first installed model the next time you open the picker. If no models are installed at all, the next request surfaces a "Model not found" error with the exact `ollama pull <name>` command to run.

The table below also lists the baked-in safety limits that govern Thuki's communication with the Ollama HTTP API. None are tunable.

| Constant                                    | Default  | Tunable? | Why not tunable                                                                                                                                                         | Bounds | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEFAULT_OLLAMA_TAGS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`  | `5 s`    | No       | Protocol cap on a hung daemon to keep the UI responsive. A longer timeout would wedge the model picker; a shorter one would false-trigger on a momentarily slow daemon. | —      | How long Thuki waits for Ollama's `/api/tags` endpoint to respond before giving up. If Ollama accepts the connection but never replies, this prevents the picker from stalling.      |
| `DEFAULT_OLLAMA_SHOW_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`  | `5 s`    | No       | Protocol cap on a hung daemon to keep the UI responsive. Same rationale as the tags timeout above.                                                                      | —      | How long Thuki waits for Ollama's `/api/show` endpoint to respond before giving up. Used when fetching capability flags (vision, thinking) for each installed model.                |
| `MAX_OLLAMA_TAGS_BODY_BYTES`                | `4 MiB`  | No       | Defense-in-depth bound on attacker-controlled response body. A misbehaving or compromised Ollama could otherwise stream an unbounded payload and exhaust memory.        | —      | The largest `/api/tags` response body Thuki will accept. 4 MiB fits thousands of model entries; anything larger is rejected immediately and the request returns an error.            |
| `MAX_OLLAMA_SHOW_BODY_BYTES`                | `4 MiB`  | No       | Defense-in-depth bound on attacker-controlled response body. Same rationale as `MAX_OLLAMA_TAGS_BODY_BYTES`.                                                            | —      | The largest `/api/show` response body Thuki will accept. Full Modelfiles and parameters can be sizable, but 4 MiB is well above any real model; larger responses are rejected.      |
| `MAX_MODEL_SLUG_LEN`                        | `256 B`  | No       | Defense-in-depth bound on adversarial input. Real Ollama slugs are a handful of characters; capping the length stops malformed values long before any network or DB work. | —      | The longest model slug Thuki will accept from `set_active_model`. Anything longer is rejected immediately by `validate_model_slug`.                                                  |
| `VRAM_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS`                   | `5 s`    | No       | Tuning this trades responsiveness against localhost polling load; 5 s is the sweet spot for loopback calls and matches Ollama's internal TTL resolution granularity. | —      | How often Thuki polls Ollama's `/api/ps` to detect VRAM changes made outside Thuki (for example, running `ollama stop` or a TTL expiry). The Settings panel VRAM indicator reflects these changes within one interval. |

### `[openrouter]`

OpenRouter settings are used when `[inference].provider = "openrouter"`. The Settings panel calls the OpenRouter model catalog, shows capability metadata from each model's input/output modalities, and shows rough input/output dollars per million tokens for the selected stack. Study Buddy Pro stores the API key only in local config. Saved Study Pack memory and embedding vectors remain local, but the text being embedded or sent to the chat model is sent to OpenRouter.

| Constant | Default | Tunable? | Why not tunable | Bounds | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `api_key` | `""` | Yes | — | any string | OpenRouter API key used as the bearer token. Required when OpenRouter is selected. |
| `base_url` | `"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"` | Yes | — | non-empty URL | OpenRouter-compatible API base URL. Keep the default unless using a compatible gateway. |
| `use_general_model` | `true` | Yes | — | boolean | When true, one model handles text, vision, and reasoning turns. Choose a model with `image` input if you want direct screenshot chat. |
| `general_model` | `"qwen/qwen3.5-flash-02-23"` | Yes | — | model id | General chat model used when `use_general_model` is true. |
| `chat_model` | `"qwen/qwen3.5-flash-02-23"` | Yes | — | model id | Text-only chat model used when separate routing is enabled. |
| `vision_model` | `"qwen/qwen3.5-flash-02-23"` | Yes | — | model id with image input | Model used for normal chat turns that include screenshots or image attachments when separate routing is enabled. |
| `reasoning_model` | `"qwen/qwen3.5-flash-02-23"` | Yes | — | model id | Reserved reasoning/verifier model for deeper checks and future planner passes. |
| `embedding_model` | `"qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b"` | Yes | — | model id with embeddings output | Model used to embed Study Pack chunks and queries. Vectors are stored in local SQLite. |
| `stt_model` | `"openai/whisper-large-v3"` | Yes | — | model id with audio input and text output | Speech-to-text model selection for future API audio input. |
| `tts_model` | `"openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts-2025-12-15"` | Yes | — | model id with audio output | Text-to-speech model selection for future API voice output. Local Supertonic remains available. |
| `app_title` | `"Study Buddy Pro"` | Yes | — | any string | Optional title sent to OpenRouter for request attribution. |
| `site_url` | GitHub repo URL | Yes | — | URL or empty | Optional referer URL sent to OpenRouter for request attribution. |

### `[prompt]`

Controls the personality and instructions Thuki gives to the AI at the start of every conversation.

| `system`                        | full built-in body (~17 KB)            | Yes      | —                                                                                                                                                     | any string | The full secretary personality prompt. Seeded into your `config.toml` on first run so the file is the single source of truth: edit, tweak, or replace it. Clearing the field via Settings sends no persona at all. Clearing it by hand in the TOML (without ever saving via Settings) is treated as an old-config migration artifact and the default is restored on the next boot. The slash-command appendix is always added on top, so `/search` etc. work either way. |
| `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_CUSTOMIZED`    | `false`                                | No       | Internal migration flag. Set to `true` the first time the user saves the system prompt via Settings. Guards the upgrade path that distinguishes configs where `system = ""` was the old compiled default from a deliberate clear made in the Settings UI. Not user-tunable because exposing it would let users suppress the safety net that restores the built-in persona on upgrade. | — | Tracks whether the user has ever explicitly saved a system prompt through the Settings UI. |
| `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_BASE`    | `prompts/system_prompt.txt`            | No       | The shipped seed for `system` on first run. Once your `config.toml` exists, only the file matters; this constant is no longer consulted at runtime. | —          | Source-of-truth file used to seed `system` on first run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Editing by hand would desync the AI's understanding of the commands from the real ones. | —          | The list of slash commands (`/search`, `/screen`, etc.) Thuki tells the AI about so it knows what each one does. Always added on top of your `system` prompt.                                                                                          |

### `[window]`

UI configuration for the floating Thuki window: geometry knobs and input attachment limits. The collapsed-bar height and the close-animation deadline are baked into the frontend (see `App.tsx`) because their effective range is invisible to users (collapsed height is overwritten by the ResizeObserver within a frame; the hide delay sits below normal perception across its usable range and creates a visible pop if dropped below the exit-animation duration).

| Constant          | Default | Tunable? | Why not tunable | Bounds            | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :---------------- | :------ | :------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `overlay_width`   | `600.0` | Yes      | —               | `[200.0, 2000.0]` | How wide the floating Thuki window is, in pixels. Raise for wider input/chat at the cost of more screen space; lower to keep Thuki compact.                                            |
| `max_chat_height` | `648.0` | Yes      | —               | `[200.0, 2000.0]` | The largest the chat window can grow to as conversation gets longer. Raise to see more chat history without scrolling; lower to keep Thuki from taking over your screen on long chats. |
| `max_images`      | `3`     | Yes      | —               | `[1, 20]`         | Maximum number of images you can manually attach to a single message by pasting or dragging. A /screen capture always counts as one extra on top of this limit. Raise for richer visual context per message; lower to keep prompts compact. |
| `text_base_px`    | `15.0`  | Yes      | —               | `[11.0, 22.0]`    | Base font size for chat text and the AskBar input, in CSS pixels. Drives the `--thuki-text-base` CSS variable consumed by the AI markdown body, the user chat bubble text, and the AskBar textarea (plus its caret-tracking mirror). Other surfaces (Settings panel, onboarding) keep fixed sizes. Raise for easier-to-read conversation text; lower to fit more text on screen. |
| `text_line_height` | `1.5` | Yes      | —               | `[1.0, 2.5]`      | Line-height multiplier applied to chat text and the AskBar input. Drives the `--thuki-text-line-height` CSS variable. Raise for airier, easier-to-skim replies; lower to fit more lines on screen. |
| `text_letter_spacing_px` | `0.0` | Yes | —             | `[-0.5, 2.0]`     | Extra space between characters, in CSS pixels. Drives the `--thuki-text-letter-spacing` CSS variable. Raise for airier letters; drop below zero to tighten the typography. |
| `text_font_weight` | `500` | Yes      | —               | `{400, 500, 600, 700}` | CSS `font-weight` applied to chat and AskBar text. Drives the `--thuki-text-font-weight` CSS variable. Only the four loaded Nunito weights are accepted; off-grid values reset to the default. Raise for a heavier presence; lower for a lighter look. |
| `COLLAPSED_WINDOW_HEIGHT` | `80 px` | No | Frontend constant; overwritten by ResizeObserver before the frame renders, so any value in the user-visible range produces identical results. | — | The initial height of the collapsed input bar, in pixels. Overwritten by ResizeObserver on every render, so the value the user sees is always determined dynamically. |
| `HIDE_COMMIT_DELAY_MS` | `350 ms` | No | Frontend constant; the value sits below normal perception across its usable range and creates a visible pop if dropped below the exit-animation duration. | — | How long Thuki waits after you close the window before it hides the underlying NSPanel. Keeps the exit animation from being cut off. |

### `[quote]`

Controls how text you select in another app (and bring to Thuki) appears as a quote in the input bar, and how much of it actually gets sent to the AI.

| Constant             | Default | Tunable? | Why not tunable | Bounds       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `max_display_lines`  | `4`     | Yes      | —               | `[1, 100]`   | How many lines of the quoted text are shown as a preview in the input bar. The full text is still sent to the AI; this only affects what you see. Raise to preview more of the quote at a glance; lower to keep the input bar compact.                             |
| `max_display_chars`  | `300`   | Yes      | —               | `[1, 10000]` | How many characters of the quoted text are shown as a preview in the input bar. Same idea as `max_display_lines`: the full text is still sent to the AI. Raise for a longer preview; lower to keep the bar compact.                                                |
| `max_context_length` | `4096`  | Yes      | —               | `[1, 65536]` | How many characters of the quoted text are actually sent to the AI. Anything past this is cut off. Raise if you quote long passages and want the AI to see all of it; lower if your model has a small context window or you want to save tokens on big selections. |

### `[search]`

Settings for the `/search` command, which lets the AI search the web and read pages to answer your question. Covers where Thuki's local search and page-reader services live, how hard it should try to find good results, and how long to wait at each step.

URLs must include scheme, host, and port, with no path. Thuki appends the rest (`/search`, `/extract`) automatically. If you leave a URL empty in your config, Thuki uses the default; if you put a number outside its allowed range, Thuki resets it to the default and logs a warning.

For security, both URLs default to your local machine (`127.0.0.1`) and should stay there. Pointing them at a remote server breaks Thuki's sandbox isolation: the page reader would fetch arbitrary URLs on behalf of the AI from a host that may have access to private networks.

Raise this for slow websites that take a while to respond. Lowering it just makes more pages get skipped.                                                                                                                     |

Must be larger than `reader_per_url_timeout_s`; if it's not, Thuki automatically bumps it to `reader_per_url_timeout_s + 5`.

### `[updater]`

Controls how Thuki polls for new releases. The actual download, signature verification, and binary swap are handled by the bundled Tauri updater plugin against a signed manifest hosted on GitHub Releases. The manifest is verified against an ed25519 public key compiled into the app, so a hijacked release cannot push a malicious binary to existing installs.

Lives in the same directory as `config.toml`.                                                      |

### `[activation]` (not in TOML)

Settings for the double-tap-Control hotkey that opens Thuki, plus the macOS Accessibility permission check. None of these are user-tunable: the hotkey listener runs in a low-level system thread that cannot read live config, so changing them would require restructuring the keyboard plumbing.

| Constant                   | Default  | Tunable? | Why not tunable                                                                                                                           | Bounds | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------- | :------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ACTIVATION_WINDOW`        | `400 ms` | No       | Event-tap callback cannot read Tauri managed state; would require a redesign to expose. No user has reported needing a different cadence. | —      | How fast you have to double-tap Control to open Thuki: the second tap must happen within this many milliseconds of the first, otherwise it does not count.  |
| `ACTIVATION_COOLDOWN`      | `600 ms` | No       | Same as above.                                                                                                                            | —      | After Thuki opens or closes, this is how long it ignores another double-tap. Prevents accidental rapid-fire toggling when you tap too many times in a row.  |
| `KC_PRIMARY_L`             | `0x3b`   | No       | macOS hardware key code for left Control. Not user-meaningful; wrong value would brick activation.                                        | —      | The internal macOS hardware code for the LEFT Control key. This is not something you set; it is just the number macOS uses to identify that key.            |
| `KC_PRIMARY_R`             | `0x3e`   | No       | macOS hardware key code for right Control. Not user-meaningful; wrong value would brick activation.                                       | —      | The internal macOS hardware code for the RIGHT Control key. Same idea as `KC_PRIMARY_L`.                                                                    |
| `MAX_PERMISSION_ATTEMPTS`  | `6`      | No       | Internal retry budget for the Accessibility prompt; no user-facing reason to tune.                                                        | —      | When you first run Thuki, it asks for Accessibility permission so it can listen for the Control key. This is how many times Thuki re-checks while it waits. |
| `PERMISSION_POLL_INTERVAL` | `5 s`    | No       | Same as above.                                                                                                                            | —      | How often (in seconds) Thuki re-checks for Accessibility permission while it waits for you to grant it.                                                     |

### `[vision]` (not in TOML)

Limits and quality settings for images you attach to a message (whether you drag them in or capture them with `/screen`). None of these are user-tunable: the image count is capped by what Ollama's vision models accept, and the size/quality settings are tuned for the best balance of file size and AI accuracy.

| Constant                 | Default   | Tunable? | Why not tunable                                                                                                          | Bounds | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :----------------------- | :-------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MAX_IMAGES_PER_MESSAGE` | `4`       | No       | Protocol cap: 3 manual attachments + 1 `/screen` capture. Larger values make requests fail further downstream in Ollama. | —      | The maximum number of images you can attach to a single message: 3 you add yourself, plus 1 captured with `/screen`. Adding more than this just makes the request fail in Ollama.    |
| `MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_BYTES`   | `30 MiB`  | No       | Frontend rejection threshold aligned with Ollama's practical decode ceiling.                                             | —      | The biggest image file you can attach (30 MB). Files larger than this are rejected before they're even processed, so an oversized image cannot crash the AI.                         |
| `MAX_DIMENSION`          | `1920 px` | No       | Downscale target that balances vision-model accuracy against payload size.                                               | —      | If an image is wider or taller than this many pixels, Thuki shrinks it to fit (keeping its aspect ratio). Keeps file sizes manageable without hurting how well vision models see it. |
| `JPEG_QUALITY`           | `85`      | No       | Balances file size against visual fidelity for vision models; changes would invalidate historical saved images.          | —      | The compression level Thuki uses when saving attached images as JPEG (on a 1–100 scale; higher = better quality and bigger file). 85 is the sweet spot for vision models.            |

### `[history]` (not in TOML)

Settings for the conversation history panel (where you scroll back through past chats and search them). Not user-tunable.

| Constant             | Default | Tunable? | Why not tunable                                                                                                                              | Bounds | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------- | :------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SEARCH_DEBOUNCE_MS` | `200`   | No       | UX tuning; no meaningful user signal for changing this. Raising it makes search feel sluggish; lowering it wastes cycles on every keystroke. | —      | When you type in the history search box, Thuki waits this many milliseconds after your last keystroke before actually running the search. Stops Thuki from running a fresh search on every single character you type, while still feeling instant. |
| `STRIP_PATTERNS`     | 17 token strings | No | Defense-in-depth bound on external/attacker-controlled data: special turn-boundary tokens leaked by fine-tuned models would corrupt cross-model history if persisted. Exposing this list as a config knob would let a malformed or adversarial model response disable the sanitization layer. | — | The set of special delimiters (e.g. `<\|im_start\|>`, `[INST]`, `<think>`) that major Ollama model families use internally. Some fine-tuned models leak these into `message.content`; Thuki strips them before storing an assistant reply and again at render time so switching between model families does not produce visible garbage in the chat window. The TypeScript mirror of this list (`src/utils/sanitizeAssistantContent.ts`) must be kept in sync when new model families are added. |

## What happens on bad input

Thuki tries to keep itself running with a working configuration rather than crash on a typo. Here is what it does in each case:

- **The file is missing**: Thuki writes a fresh defaults file and launches normally.
- **A field is missing**: Thuki uses the default for that field; your other settings stay as-is.
- **A field is empty or just whitespace**: Thuki uses the default for that field.
- **A number is outside its allowed range**: Thuki resets that field to the default and logs a warning. (You can see warnings in `Console.app`.)
- **The file is not valid TOML at all**: Thuki renames the broken file to `config.toml.corrupt-<unix_timestamp>` and writes a fresh defaults file. Your old file is kept so you can open it and copy out anything you want to recover.
